   <p>In this article, we discuss a general framework to drastically reduce the influence of outliers in most contexts. It applies to problems such as clustering (finding centroids,) regression, measuring correlation or R-Squared, and many more. We will focus on the centroid problem here, as it is very similar and generalizes easily to solving a linear regression. The correlation / R-Squared issue was discussed in an earlier article and involves only a change of formula. Clustering and regression are more complex problems involving iterative algorithms.  

This article also features interesting material for future data scientists, such as

    <h2>1. General Framework</h2>
    <p> We discuss replacing techniques used by statisticians, based on optimizing traditional L^2 metrics such as variance, by techniques based on L^ metrics, which are more robust when 1
        < < 2. The case=2 corresponds to the traditional framework, Throughout the article, is referred to as the power. The regression and centroid problems being equivalent, we focus here on finding a centroid using the L^ criterion (denoted as H), and we show how to modify it for regression problems. Illustrations are in a 2-dimensional space (=2 ) but easily generalize to any dimension, especially as we are not using any matrix inversions to solve the problem.</p>

            <h2>Finding a robust centroid</h2>
            <p> The focus here is on finding the point that minimizes the sum of the "distances" to points in a -dimensional space, called centroid or center, .</p>
            </hr>
            <h2>especially in the presence of outliers</h2>
            <p> The sum of "distances" between an arbitrary point (, ) and a set S = { (x(1), y(1)) ... (x(), y()) } of points is defined as follows:</p>
            <p> H((,), S; ) = SUM{ ( + |x(k) - )^ + ( + |y(k) - v|^ } /</p>
            <p> where is a very small positive quantity, equal to zero unless is negative; the sum is over = 1,...,.</p>
            <p> The function H has one parameter called , and when = 2, we are facing the traditional problem of finding the centroid of a cloud of points: in this case, the solution is the classic average of the points. This solution is notoriously sensitive to outliers. When 1
                < < 2, we get get a more stable solution, less sensitive to outliers, yet when is large (> 20) and the proportion of outliers is small (by definition it is always small!), the solution is pretty much the same regardless of (assuming 1
                    < < 3).</p>
                        <p> In short, what we are trying to accomplish here is to build a robust measure of centrality in any dimension, just like the median is a robust measure of centrality in dimension = 1.</p>

                        <h2>Generalization to linear regression problems</h2>
                        <p> The same methodology can be used for regression. With 2 parameters and as in Y = X + , the function H becomes</p>
                        <p> + |y(k) - x(k) -</p>
                        <p> again with e = 0 if > 0. It generalizes easily to more than 2 parameters , .</p>

                        <h2>General outlier detection techniques</h2>
                        <p> Our proposed method smooths out the impact of outliers rather than detecting them. For outlier detection and removal, you can use one of these methods:</p>
                        <p> Using traditional centrality measures and eliminating the points farthest away from the center, then re-computing the center and proceeding iteratively with eliminating newly found outliers until stability is reached.</p>
                        <p> Using the median both for the x- and y-coordinates, rather than the average.</p>
                        <p> The technique consists of computing the convex hull of your data set S, then removing one point at a time, and re-computing the convex hull after removing the point in question. The point resulting in the largest loss of volume in the convex hull, when removed, corresponds to the strongest outlier.</p>

                        <p> Another way to attenuate the impact of outliers is to use a weighted sum for H, that is (in the case of the regression problem) to use the formula</p>
                        <p> ) = SUM{ q() * (</p>
                        <p> + |y(k) - x(k) -</p>
                        <p> where q() is the weight attached to point , with SUM{ q() } = 1. In this case, a point with low density is assigned a smaller weight.</p>

                        <h2>A related physics problem</h2>
                        <p> When
                            < 0, and especially when=- 2, maximizing or minimizing H becomes an interesting physics problem of optimizing a potential H. The centroid problem is now equivalent to finding the point of maximum or minimum light, sound, radioactivity, or heat intensity, in the presence of an energy field produced by energy source points. Both problems are closely related and use the same algorithm to find solutions.</p>
                                <p> However, the case
                                    < 0 has no practical value to data scientists or statisticians (as far as I know) and it presents the following challenges:</p>
                                        <p> If (, ) is a point of S and
                                            < 0, then H((,), S; ) is infinite: we have singularities. This is dealt with by introducing the very small constant> 0 in the definition of H. This quantity is used to address the fact that in the real world, no source of energy is a point with an area of zero and positive (but finite) intensity. This artifact of physics models .</p>
                                        <p> is discussed here</p>
                                        <p> If you want to minimize H, there will be an infinite number of solutions, all located far outside the cloud of points S. Think about finding the point in the universe that receives the least amount of light from the solar system. So typically one is interested in finding a maximum, not a minimum (unless you put constraints on the solution, such as being located inside the convex hull of S.)</p>
                                        <p> Even if searching for a maximum of H, the convergence may be slow and chaotic, as you can end up with several maxima (H is no longer a nice, smooth curve when
                                            < 0.)</p>

                                                <h2>2. Algorithm to find centroid when > 1</h2>
                                                <p> There are many algorithms available to solve this type of mathematical optimization problem. A popular class of algorithms is based on . Here however, we use what is possibly the simplest algorithm. Why? For two reasons. First it is very easy to understand, still leads to some interesting research, is easy to replicate, and keep the focus on the concepts and the results associated with the centroids, rather than on a specific implementation. Second, with modern computers (even on my 10 years old laptop) the computing power is big enough that naive algorithms perform well. If you are OK with getting results accurate to two or three digits -- and in real life, many data sets, even web analytics measured using two different sources, do not have higher accuracy -- then a rudimentary algorithm is enough.</p>

                                                <p> So here I used rudimentary Monte-Carlo to find the centroids. However, in higher dimensions ( > 3) be careful about the . Note that when
                                                    < 0, Monte Carlo is not that bad, as it allows you to visit and circle around several local minima. It is also easy to deploy in a Map-Reduce environment (Hadoop.) The algorithm is actually so simple that there is no need to describe it: the short, easy-to-read source code below (Perl) speaks for itself.</p>

This "10,000 iterations" is actually a rule of thumb for any Monte-Carlo algorithm used to find an optimum with two correct digits. Note that in Figure 3, only iterations providing an improvement over the current approximation of the centroid -- that is, iterations where the value of H is smaller than those computed in all previous iterations -- are displayed. A potential research topic is to investigate the asymptotic behavior of these "records", in the example below occurring at iterations 0, 4, 12, 44, 109, 156, and so on.</p>
