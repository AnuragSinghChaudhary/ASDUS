    <h2>What are cookies</h2>
    <p> We and our business partners collect information about your use of our website through cookies. Cookies are information files stored on your computer, tablet or smartphone that help websites remember who you are and information about your visit. Cookies can help to display the information on a website in a way that matches your interests. Most major websites use cookies.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>What cookies are used on this Website</h2>
    <p> The cookies we and our business partners use on this website are broadly grouped into the following categories:</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Essential</h2>
    <p> Some of the cookies on our website are essential for us to be able to provide you with a service you have requested. An example of this would be a cookie used to enable you to log into your account on the website, place items in your shopping basket or which allows communication between your browser and the website.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p> We use analytics cookies to help us understand how users engage with our website. An example is counting the number of different people coming to our website or using a particular feature, rather than the total number of times the site or feature is used. Without this cookie, if you visited the website once each week for three weeks we would count you as three separate users. We would find it difficult to analyse how well our website was performing and improve it without these cookies.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>User Cookies</h2>
    <p> We use cookies to improve your experience by remembering your preferences so we know how you like to use our website. Examples of this would be remembering you so that you are served with the same content, to remember you when you come back to the site or to remember that you like logging in via Facebook or other social media sites.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Social Sharing</h2>
    <p> We use cookies to allow you to share content directly on the social networking/sharing sites, like Facebook, Twitter or Google+. Examples would be if you wanted to ?like? or ?tweet? about a business or product advertised on our website.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Interest-Based Advertising</h2>
    <p> You will have noticed that when you visit websites you will be shown adverts for products and services you may wish to buy. The money made by website owners for showing third party adverts on their websites often pays for the cost of running the website and therefore usually allows you to use the website without having to pay a registration or usage fee. Hibu like many businesses place adverts for itself and its customers on a range of its partners websites. However, to try and ensure that the adverts you see are relevant to you we use cookies to collect information about the types of things that interest you, for example websites you visit and the geography that you are based in. Having these cookies does not increase the number of adverts you will be shown, but simply makes the adverts you see more relevant.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>How can I reject or opt out of receiving cookies?</h2>
    <p> Please note that we can?t always control third party cookies stored on your machine from our website and setting your cookie preferences with us will not stop those third party cookies from being stored on your machine, you must manage these cookies directly with the relevant third party, please see our ?Third Party Cookies? section below for more information.</p>
