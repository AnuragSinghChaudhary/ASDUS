    <p> Grammarly runs on powerful algorithms developed by the world’s leading linguists, and it can save you from misspellings, hundreds of types of grammatical and punctuation mistakes, and words that are spelled right but used in the wrong context.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>Other</h2>
    <p> This word appeared over five million times in a day across Grammarly products. It’s understandable why — “other” is applicable to basically any situation where you’re trying to figure something out with a person. You can ask for “any other suggestions,” solicit “other opinions,” or ask someone for “other times” that work for them.</p>
    <p>Try these alternatives: times, suggestions, opinions.</p>
   
    </hr>
    <h2>More</h2>
    <p> “More” is one of those catchall terms. In some cases, “more” can mean the same thing as “other.” Sometimes, this is just the most accurate word to use, so don’t worry too much about trying to get this one out of rotation. Check out “other” for some alternatives.</p>
    <p> perspectives, improvements, context</p>
    <p> Try these alternatives:incremental</p>
   
    </hr>
    <h2>New</h2>
    <p> New products, new information, new person. We’re encountering new things every day. But “new” could refer to things like time, technology, or an update. Specify what kind of “new” you mean, and use that word instead.</p>
    <p> technology, document, processes.</p>
    <p> Try these alternatives:state-of-the-art</p>
    
    </hr>
    <h2>Good</h2>
    <p> “Good” is just good enough. Next time you qualify something as “good,” think about it is. You could be referring to something that’s slightly better than something else, something that’s suitable, or something that’s good. Chances are, there’s a word to suit each situation.</p>
   
    <p> Try these alternatives: solution, option, substitute</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Best</h2>
    <p> Similar to “good,” “best” isn’t the only way to provide a superlative. Are you looking for the top-quality pair of socks, or the pair of socks that are perfect for you? Both of these pairs of socks could be the “best.”</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> Try these alternatives:incomparable, choice, product, expert.</p>

    <h2>Many</h2>
    <p> “Many” may seem like a go-to option when referring to an indeterminate group of things. But if you have an idea of the volume of what you’re talking about, it’s better to narrow it down. If you don’t, there are additional, interesting ways to express a vague number.</p>

    <h2>Important</h2>
    <p> We all believe our emails are important. But you can almost guarantee that your readers’ eyes will skip right past the word “important,” since they see it so often. Distinguish your information by giving it a colorful description—but don’t go overboard on it.</p>
   
    </hr>
    <h2>Great</h2>
    <p> “Great” is a stronger word than “good,” but not by much. If you’re already expressing enthusiasm for something, set it apart.</p>

    <p> Try these alternatives:ideas, opportunity, work.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>First</h2>
    <p> “First” is the initial (see what we did there?) word most people think of when starting a list. If you really are listing a series of items or steps, don’t worry too much about using this one. But similar words can get the job done.</p>
  
    <p> Try these alternatives:conclusion, person, priority.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Able</h2>
    <p> You may not think of “able” as an oft-used adjective, but this word appears whenever you ask someone if they will “be able” to complete a task. Next time you want to ask someone if they’ll “be able” to do something, use another phrase.</p>
