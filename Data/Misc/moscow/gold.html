    <p> 8 Things to Do in Moscow Idaho</p>
   
    <h2>8 Things to Do in Moscow Idaho</h2>
    <p> Moscow is located about 8 miles from Pullman, Washington (home of Washington State University) and home to one of the best colleges in Idaho, . I’m a bit bias because I went to school here, but if you ever make it to it’s worth a quick trip! You’ll find it easy to get to if you’re in Northern Idaho or close toor Sandpoint. The rolling hills of the Palouse surrounding Moscow are breathtaking and the college campus, which makes up the majority of the town, is oldest school. The campus itself is charming with brick buildings covered in ivy, large lawns and massive fraternity and sorority houses.</p>

    <p> The town itself is granola/hippie in nature (different from other parts of Idaho) and has a wonderful farmer’s market, great breweries, cute shops and fun art festivals all year round. It’s a great place to walk around and explore for a day or two in the summer or while school is in session!</p>

    <h2>2. Hello Walk.</h2>
    <p> This path is super famous with University of Idaho students as it’s one of the main walkways on campus. It runs from Greek Row to the Administration Building and you can’t miss it! The large trees and steps leading up to the admin building are beautiful in all seasons. This path was coined, “Hello Walk”, because you see everyone you know walking up and down it.</p>
