	<p>Botany, branch of biology that deals with the study of plants, including their structure, properties, and biochemical processes. Also included are plant classification and the study of plant diseases and of interactions with the environment. The principles and findings of botany have provided the base for such applied sciences as agriculture, horticulture, and forestry.</p>
	<h2>Historical Background</h2>
	<p>Theophrastus, a Greek philosopher who studied first with Plato and then became a disciple of Aristotle, is credited with founding botany. Only two of an estimated 200 botanical treatises written by him are known to science: originally written in Greek about 300 BC, they have survived in the form of Latin manuscripts, De causis plantarum and De historia plantarum. His basic concepts of morphology, classification, and the natural history of plants, accepted without question for many centuries, are now of interest primarily because of Theophrastus’ independent and philosophical viewpoint.

Pedanius Dioscorides, a Greek botanist of the 1st century AD, was the most important botanical writer after Theophrastus. In his major work, an herbal in Greek, he described some 600 kinds of plants, with comments on their habit of growth and form as well as on their medicinal properties. Unlike Theophrastus, who classified plants as trees, shrubs, and herbs, Dioscorides grouped his plants under three headings: as aromatic, culinary, and medicinal. His herbal, unique in that it was the first treatment of medicinal plants to be illustrated, remained for about 15 centuries the last word on medical botany in Europe.</p>
    <p> For convenience, but not on any mutually basis, several major areas or approaches are recognized commonly as of botany; these are morphology, physiology, ecology, and systematics.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>Morphology</h2>
    <p> Morphology deals with the structure and form of plants and includes such subdivisions as: , the study of the cell; morphogenesis, the study of tissues; , the study of the organization of tissues into the organs of the plant; reproductive morphology, the study of life cycles; and experimental morphology, or , the study of development.</p>

    <h2>Physiology</h2>
    <p> Physiology deals with the functions of plants. Its development as a subdiscipline has been closely interwoven with the development of other aspects of botany, especially morphology. In fact, structure and function are sometimes so closely related that it is impossible to consider one independently of the other. The study of function is indispensable for the interpretation of the incredibly nature of plant structures. In other words, around the functions of the plant, structure and form have evolved. Physiology also blends imperceptibly into the fields of and , as the research methods of these fields are used to solve problems in plant physiology.</p>

    <h2>Ecology</h2>
    <p> Ecology deals with the mutual relationships and interactions between organisms and their physical environment. The physical factors of the atmosphere, the communities, and the soil affect the physiological functions of the plant in all its manifestations, so that, to a large degree, plant ecology is a phase of plant physiology under natural and uncontrolled conditions; in fact, it has been called “outdoor physiology.” Plants are intensely sensitive to the forces of the environment, and both their association into and their geographical distribution are determined largely by the character of climate and soil. Moreover, the pressures of the environment and of organisms upon each other are potent forces, which lead to new species and the continuing evolution of larger groups.</p>
   
    <p> Systematics deals with the identification and ranking of all plants; it includes classification and nomenclature (naming) and enables the botanist to comprehend the broad range of plant and evolution.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Other subdisciplines</h2>
    <p> In addition to the major subdisciplines, several specialized branches of botany have developed as a matter of custom or convenience. Among them are bacteriology, the study of bacteria; ethnobotany, the study of fungi; or phycology, the study of algae; bryology, the study of mosses and liverworts; pteridology, the study of ferns and their relatives; and paleobotany, the study of fossil plants. Palynology is the study of modern and fossil pollen and spores, with particular reference to their identification; plant deals with the diseases of plants; economic botany deals with plants of practical use to man; and covers the use of plants by aboriginal peoples, now and in the distant past.</p>
    
    <p> Botany also relates to other scientific disciplines in many ways, especially to microbiology, medicine, , agriculture, chemistry, forestry, and horticulture, and specialized areas of botanical information may relate closely to such humanistic fields as art, literature, history, religion, archaeology, sociology, and psychology.</p>
   
    <p> Fundamentally, botany remains a pure science, including any research into the life of plants and limited only by man’s technical means of satisfying his curiosity. It has often been considered an important part of a liberal education, not only because it is necessary for an understanding of agriculture, horticulture, forestry, pharmacology, and other applied arts and sciences, but also because an understanding of plant life is related to life in general.</p>
        <p> Because man has always been dependent upon plants and surrounded by them, he has woven them into his designs, into the ornamentation of his life, even into his . A Persian carpet and a bedspread from a loom both employ conventional designs derived from the forms of flowers. painters and great masters of the Renaissance represented various revered figures surrounded by roses, lilies, violets, and other flowers, which symbolized chastity, martyrdom, humility, and other Christian attributes.</p>

    <h2>Morphological aspects</h2>
    <p> The invention of the compound microscope provided a valuable and durable instrument for the investigation of the inner structure of plants. Early plant morphologists, especially those studying cell structure, were handicapped as much by the lack of adequate knowledge of how to prepare specimens as they were by the imperfect microscopes of the time. A revolution in the effectiveness of microscopy occurred in the second half of the 19th century with the introduction of techniques for fixing cells and for staining their component parts. Before the development of these techniques, the cell, viewed with the microscope, appeared as a minute container with a dense portion called the . The discovery that parts of the cell respond to certain stains made observation easier. The development of techniques for preparing tissues of plants for microscopic examination was continued in the 1870s and 1880s and resulted in the gradual refinement of the field of nuclear cytology, or karyology. Chromosomes were recognized as constant structures in the life cycle of cells, and the nature and meaning of , a type of in which the daughter cells have half the number of chromosomes of the parent, was discovered; without this discovery, the significance of Mendel’s laws of heredity might have gone unrecognized. Vital stains, dyes that can be used on living material, were first used in 1886 and have been greatly refined since then.</p>
   
    <p> Improvement of the methodology of morphology has not been particularly rapid, even though satisfactory techniques for histology, anatomy, and cytology have been developed. The embedding of material in paraffin wax, the development of the rotary for slicing very thin sections of for microscope viewing, and the development of stain techniques are refinements of previously known methods. The invention of the phase microscope made possible the study of unfixed and unstained living material—hopefully nearer its natural state. The development of the electron microscope, however, has provided the plant morphologist with a new dimension of magnification of the structure of plant cells and tissues. The fine structure of the cell and of its components, such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus, have come under intensive study. Knowledge of the fine structure of plant cells has enabled investigators to determine the sites of important biochemical activities, especially those involved in the transfer of energy during photosynthesis and respiration. The scanning electron microscope, a relatively recent development, provides a three-dimensional image of surface structures at very great magnifications.</p>
   
    <p> For experimental research on the morphogenesis of plants, isolated organs in their embryonic stage, clumps of cells, or even individual cells are grown. One of the most interesting techniques developed thus far permits the growing of plant tissue of higher plants as single cells; aeration and continuous agitation keep the cells suspended in the liquid culture medium.</p>

    <h2>Physiological aspects</h2>
    <p> Plant physiology and plant biochemistry are the most technical areas of botany; most major advances in physiology also reflect the development of either a new technique or the dramatic refinement of an earlier one to give a new degree of precision. Fortunately, the methodology of measurement has been vastly improved in recent decades, largely through the development of various electronic devices. The at the represents the first serious attempt to control the environment of living plants on a relatively large scale; much important information has been gained concerning the effects on plants of day length and night length and the effects on growth, flowering, and fruiting of varying night temperatures. Critical measurements of other plant functions have also been obtained.</p>
  
    <p> Certain complex biochemical processes, such as photosynthesis and respiration, have been studied stepwise by immobilizing the process through the use of extreme cold or biochemical inhibitors and by analyzing the enzymatic activity of specific cell contents after spinning cells at very high speeds in a centrifuge. The pathways of energy transfer from to molecule during photosynthesis and respiration have been determined by biophysical methods, especially those utilizing radioactive isotopes.</p>
    <p> An investigation of the natural metabolic products of plants requires, paper chromatography in general, certain standard biochemical techniques— gas and electrophoresis, spectroscopy, and various kinds of nuclear magnetic resonance, including infrared, ultraviolet, and . Useful information on the structure of the extremely large molecule has been provided by X-ray crystallography.</p>

    <h2>Ecological aspects</h2>
    <p> When plant ecology first emerged as a subscience of botany, it was largely descriptive; today, however, it has become a common meeting ground for all the plant sciences, as well as for other sciences. In addition, it has become much more quantitative. As a result, the tools and methods of plant ecologists are those available for measuring the intensity of the environmental factors that impinge on the plant and the reaction of the plant to these factors. The extent of the variability of many physical factors must be measured. The and reporting of such measurements, which cannot be regarded as constant, may therefore conceal some of the most and significant aspects of the environment and the responses of the plant to them. Because the physical environment is a complex of biological and physical components, it is measured by biophysical tools. The development of electronic measuring and recording devices has been crucial for a better understanding of the of the environment. Such devices, however, produce so much information that computer techniques must be used to reduce the data to meaningful results.</p>
   
    <p> The ecologist, concerned primarily with measuring the effect of the external environment on a plant, adapts the methodology of the plant physiologist to field conditions.</p>
    <p> The plant sociologist, on the other hand, is concerned with both the relation of different kinds of plants to each other and the nature and constitution of their association into natural communities. One widely used technique in this respect is to count the various kinds of plants within a standard area in order to determine such factors as the percentage of ground cover, dominance of species, aggressiveness, and other characteristics of the . In general, the plant sociologist has relatively few quantitative factors to measure and must therefore take a subjective and intuitive approach, which, nevertheless, gives extremely useful results and some degree of predictability.</p>
    <p> Some ecologists are most concerned with the inner environment of the plant and the way in which it reacts to the external environment. This approach, which is essentially physiological and biochemical, is useful for determining energy flow in ecosystems. The physiological ecologist is also concerned with evaluating the that certain plants have made toward survival in a hostile environment.</p>
    <p> adaptations</p>
    <p> In summary, the techniques and methodology of plant ecology are as diverse and as varied as the large number of sciences that are drawn upon by ecologists. Completely new techniques, although few, are important; among them are techniques for measuring the amount of radioactive carbon-14 in plant deposits up to 50,000 years old. The most important new method in plant ecology is the rapidly growing use of computer techniques for handling vast amounts of data. Furthermore, modern digital computers can be used to simulate simple ecosystems and to analyze real ones.</p>

    <h2>Taxonomic aspects</h2>
    <p> Experimental research under controlled conditions, made possible by and their ranges of greenhouses and controlled environmental chambers, has become an part of the methodology of modern plant taxonomy.</p>
