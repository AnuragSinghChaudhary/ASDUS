    <h2>The ClueWeb09 Dataset</h2>
    <p> The ClueWeb09 dataset was created to support research on information retrieval and related human language technologies. It consists of about 1 billion web pages in ten languages that were collected in January and February 2009. The dataset is used by several tracks of the TREC conference.</p>

    <p> Dataset Distribution:</p>
    <p> The ClueWeb09 dataset and subsets are distributed in several different ways.</p>
    <p> The full dataset is distributed as tarred/gzipped files on four 1.5 terabyte (TB) hard disk drives, in Linux ext3 format. The physical drives are standard SATA 3 Gbit/sec (SATA/300) 3.5" drives that should be compatible with any SATA/300 interface, including external USB to SATA/300 enclosures.</p>
    <p> Full, 4 x 1.5TB:</p>
    <p> The full dataset is also available as tarred/gzipped files on two 3.0 terabyte (TB) hard disk drives, in Linux ext3 format . The physical drives are standard SATA 6 Gbit/sec (SATA/600) 3.5"</p>
    <p> Full, 2 x 3.0TB:</p>
    <p> Check that your system’s operating system and hardware are compatiable with 3 TB drives (not all SATA external enclosures are compatiable with these drives).</p>
    <p> The TREC "Category B" subset of the full dataset is distributed as tarred/gzipped files on one 1.0 gigabyte (GB) hard disk drive, in Linux ext3 format. The physical drive is a SATA 3 Gbit/sec (SATA/300) 3.5" drives that should be compatible with any SATA/ interface, including external USB to SATA 300 enclosures.</p>
    <p> CatB, 1 x 500GB:</p>
    <p> The Japanese subset of the full dataset is distributed as tarred/gzipped files on one 500 gigabyte (GB) hard disk drive, in Linux ext3 format. The physical drive is a SATA 3 Gbit/sec (SATA/300) 3.5" drive that should be compatible with any SATA/300 interface, including external USB to SATA/300 enclosures.</p>
    <p> JA, 1 x 500GB:</p>
    <p> The subset used by the TREC 2011 Crowdsourcing track is downloaded from the web.</p>
    <p> T11Crowd, web:</p>
    <p> File Formats and Sample Data:</p>
    <p> Web pages are in the WARC file format. Each WARC file is about 1 gigabyte, uncompressed. Each WARC file contains several tens of thousands of web pages (e.g., 40,000). Each WARC file is compressed by gzip.</p>

    <h2>Using A Hosted Copy of the ClueWeb09 Dataset</h2>
    <p> The ClueWeb09 dataset is available on several 'cloud computer' services (e.g., Open Cloud, the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center). It can also be accessed using provided by the .</p>
    <p> search interfaces</p>
    <p> Lemur Project</p>
    <p> A ClueWeb09 dataset license is required before you can begin using a hosted copy of the dataset. There is no cost for a dataset license; it is free.</p>
    <p> The process for obtaining a ClueWeb09 dataset license is described below.</p>
    <p> This process takes two weeks. Please allow enough time. We do not have the power to hurry the university administrators that must approve your license.</p>
    <p> Sign an . The person signing must also of the agreement on the bottom right corner.</p>

    <p> The organizational data license typically applies to a single research group or unit within a larger legal entity. For example, in a university, the organizational license might apply to a research group consisting of a few professors, and the students and staff doing research with them. In this case, the would be the name of the research group (e.g., the Information Retrieval Laboratory), and the would be the name of the university.</p>
