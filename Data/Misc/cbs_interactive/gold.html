    <h2>Managing Third Parties' Behaviorally Targeted Advertising on Your Computer</h2>
    <p> A number of the companies that use cookies to collect information about your online activities using web-based advertising are members of the Network Advertising Initiative("NAI"). The NAI offers a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads from member companies. To opt out of information collection by NAI member companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit the  NAI consumer opt out page. Also, through the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites. To learn more and make choices about interest-based ads from participating third parties, please visit the DAA consumer opt out page, European DAA online choice page and Australian DAA online choice page.</p>
   
    <p> If you opt out of having your information used to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you will continue to see advertisements on our Services, but these advertisements may not be as relevant to you.</p>
