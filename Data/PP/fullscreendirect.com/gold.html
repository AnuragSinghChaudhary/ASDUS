Company shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Company’s reasonable control. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Company’s prior written consent. Company may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without consent. Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement (provided that if a separate written agreement with respect to Company products or services exists between you and Company, the terms and conditions of that written agreement shall take precedence over this Agreement in the event of any conflict).

    </hr>
    <h2>4. How Your Information is Shared</h2>
    <p> 4.1 Sharing by you</p>
    <p> The Service is social by their very nature, so your participation in the Service will allow others to see your name and/or username, profile picture, and social profile.</p>
    <p> Certain user-profile information, including without limitation a user’s name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Service, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Service or address your request for Company’s services. Your account privacy settings allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by others. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Service and other users can contact you through messages and comments. Additionally, if you sign into the Service through a third party social networking site or service, your list of “friends” from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Service, and such “friends,” if they are also registered users of the Service, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Service user-profile. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.</p>
    <p> Some parts of our Service will enable you to share your interactions with our Service, such as content viewed, user generated content posted, and other social interactions. If you connect to our Service through a third party application (e.g., Facebook), then you further understand that we may automatically share your interactions with our Service with that third party application.</p>
    <p> 4.2 Sharing by us</p>
    <p> We share your Information with third parties as listed below and as otherwise described elsewhere in this Policy:</p>
    <p> We employ third parties to perform tasks on our behalf, such as payment processing, data management and analytics, marketing, communication and IT services, and we need to share your Information with them in order for them to provide such products and services. Unless we tell you differently or you consent otherwise, these third parties do not have any right to use your Information beyond what is necessary to assist us in providing such products and services. Any uses of your Information by these third parties will remain governed by security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Policy and applicable law.</p>
    </hr>

    </hr>

    <p> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any Information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, interests, or safety of our Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
    </hr>

    <p> Subject to your consent, we may share your Information with third party businesses or sites that we do not control. In those instances, your Information will be subject to their separate privacy policies and you should review those policies in advance before providing consent.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>With Your Consent</h2>
    <p> We may share your Information collected using the Service on the User Site with the creators and/or administrators of such User Site. Such User Site will be subject to a separate privacy policy governing the User Site’s collection and use of your information, so please carefully review such separate privacy policy before using the User Site. To the extent that there is a conflict between the provisions of this Privacy Policy and the provisions of the User Site’s privacy policy, if any, then the provisions of this Privacy Policy shall apply with respect to our use of Information and the User Site’s privacy policy shall apply with respect to the User Site’s use of Information.</p>

    <h2>DMCA / Copyright Claims Policy</h2>
    <p> StageBloc, Inc. (a Fullscreen, Inc. company) (“StageBloc”) respects others' intellectual property rights and adheres to the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). It is StageBloc’s policy to (1) block access to or remove material that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our users, members, advertisers, affiliates, content providers; and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders. This policy applies to the website www.fullscreendirect.com and such other mobile applications and websites as may be owned and/or operated by StageBloc (collectively, the “Sites”), however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise. If you believe that material(s) on the Sites violate your intellectual property rights, please follow the guidelines and procedures below to provide StageBloc with appropriate notice. StageBloc responds to written notices alleging infringement that comply with the DMCA and other applicable laws. StageBloc will remove allegedly infringing material from the Sites upon receipt of a valid DMCA notice as required by the DMCA and will provide the allegedly infringing party with a copy of the DMCA notice alleging infringement. If the party who posted the allegedly infringing information files a valid counter notification, the materials will be reposted unless you file a claim for relief as further set forth in the DMCA.</p>
    <p> All notices must be provided to StageBloc's DMCA Agent in hard copy (e.g., U.S. mail or e-mail). StageBloc does not accept notices or counter-notifications under the DMCA submitted by telephone or electronically via the Sites. You may wish to consult with legal counsel to assist you with assessing your claim(s) and understanding your rights and liabilities, including, without limitation, your potential liability for filing a false claim.</p>
