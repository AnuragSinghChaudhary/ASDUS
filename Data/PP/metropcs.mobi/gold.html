    <h2>MetroPCS Terms and Conditions of Service</h2>
    <p> Revised: June 2, 2017</p>
    <p> When you initiate Service with MetroPCS, you may receive a Start of Service form and this Agreement. These materials, including applicable supplemental terms and conditions, and your Rate Plan terms, are part of your Agreement with MetroPCS (collectively, the “Agreement”). This Agreement governs the sale, use, and delivery of MetroPCS wireless services ("Service" or "Services") to you (the purchaser or user of the Services) by T-Mobile USA, Inc. and any of its controlled subsidiaries, assignees, and agents ("us," "we," "our" or "MetroPCS"). Certain other laws may also govern our provision of Services to you and such laws are incorporated in their entirety by this reference into this Agreement as if set forth in this Agreement. Your Service is also subject to, and you agree to adhere to, our business policies, practices, and procedures, which we can change at any time without notice to you (collectively, the "Policies"). Offers may not be available everywhere or combinable with other promotions/options. Your Rate Plan includes your allotments for minutes, messages or data, rates, coverage and other terms (“Rate Plan”). The Agreement makes up the complete agreement between you and us, and supersedes any and all prior and contemporaneous agreements, arrangements, representations, advertising, contracts, statements, offers, and understandings relating to the subject matter of the Agreement, whether oral or written, including, but not limited to, all previous versions of the Terms and Conditions of Service. You cannot rely on any other documents or statements by any sales person, service representative or other agent. You acknowledge and agree that you have not relied on any representation, assertion, guarantee, warranty, contract or other assurance, stated or made by anyone except those set out in this Agreement.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>: READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES THE USE OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN LITIGATION BECAUSE IT USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY AND ALLOWS FOR LESS DISCOVERY AND LESS APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>IMPORTANT</h2>
    <p> YOUR AGREEMENT WITH METROPCS STARTS WHEN YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. YOU AGREE TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND POLICIES BY DOING ANY OF THE FOLLOWING: (A) GIVING US A WRITTEN OR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE, OR TELLING US ORALLY THAT YOU ACCEPT; (B) ACTIVATING OR CONTINUING SERVICE; (C) USING YOUR SERVICE AFTER YOUR SERVICE IS ACTIVATED OR YOU MAKE A CHANGE OR ADDITION TO YOUR SERVICE; (D) PAYING FOR THE SERVICE; OR (E) FAILING TO ACTIVATE SERVICE WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE PURCHASE OF YOUR WIRELESS DEVICE.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Acceptance.</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>IF YOU ARE A NEW CUSTOMER AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT DO ANY OF THESE THINGS.</h2>
    <p> ; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IF YOU CHOOSE TO TERMINATE SERVICE YOU WILL STILL BE BOUND BY THE PRIOR AGREEMENT, INCLUDING YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY ANY OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS AND YOUR AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, DO NOT ACTIVATE OR USE YOUR SERVICE, AND CONTACT METROPCS OR ITS AUTHORIZED DEALERS TO HAVE YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>IF YOU ARE AN EXISTING CUSTOMER AND THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED TO YOU UNDER A PRIOR AGREEMENT AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MUST TERMINATE SERVICE AS SET FORTH IN THE PRIOR AGREEMENT</h2>
    <p> This includes any claims against other parties relating to Services or wireless devices provided or billed to you (such as our suppliers, Dealers or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding. "Dispute" shall be given the broadest possible meaning and shall include any dispute, claim, or controversy arising from or relating to this Agreement or Services and/or Products provided under this Agreement, including but not limited to: (1) all claims for relief and all theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, fraud, or misrepresentation; (2) all disputes regarding the validity, enforceability or scope of this arbitration agreement (with the exception of its class action waiver); (3) all disputes that arose before this Agreement; (4) all disputes that arise after the termination of this Agreement; and (5) all disputes that are the subject of a putative class action in which no class has been certified. References in this provision to "us" include our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns and our and their directors, officers, employees and agents. References in this provision to "you" include all beneficiaries of this Agreement and all users of the Services provided under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court or bring Disputes to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, but not limited to, the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>2. * Dispute Resolution and Arbitration. We each agree that, except as provided below, any and all claims or Disputes between you and us, in any way related to or concerning the Agreement, our Privacy Policy, our Services, devices or products, will be resolved by binding arbitration.</h2>
    <p> If you do not wish to be bound by this arbitration agreement, you must notify us of your desire to do so within 30 days of initiating Service, or, if you have never had the opportunity to opt out of arbitration, within 30 days of the date of the change notice giving you the opportunity. To do so, please visit and follow the instructions on that site. Your decision to opt out of this arbitration agreement will not adversely affect our relationship with or delivery of Service to you. If you have previously notified us of your decision to opt out of this arbitration agreement, you need not do so again.</p>
    <p> www.metropcsdisputeresolution.com</p>
    <p> For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to the address in Section 16 below. We each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. If we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive your claim description, you may pursue your claim in arbitration. We each agree that if you fail to timely pay amounts due, we may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court, claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or this Agreement.</p>
    <p> Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if we change this arbitration agreement, you may reject the change without terminating or adversely affecting your Service by notifying us in writing at the address set forth in the "Notices" section below within 30 days of the date of the change notice. If you do, you shall arbitrate any Dispute in accordance with the terms of this arbitration agreement. If you do not, you will be bound by the changes.</p>
    <p> Because this Agreement and the Services provided under this Agreement concern interstate commerce, this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA").</p>
    <p> The party initiating arbitration may choose from the following independent, impartial arbitration administrators:</p>
    <p> 335 Madison Avenue, Floor 10 New York, NY 10017 1-800-778-7879 www.adr.org</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>American Arbitration Association</h2>
    <p> Copies of their respective rules for consumer disputes and forms and instructions for initiating arbitration may be obtained by contacting them or visiting their websites. Any arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the arbitration administrator's rules for consumer disputes in effect when the arbitration is initiated except to the extent they are inconsistent with this arbitration agreement. If the arbitration administrator will not enforce this arbitration agreement as written, the parties shall agree on or mutually petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a substitute arbitration administrator who will do so. The arbitrator shall enforce contractual, statutory and other limitation periods and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. Judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>
    <p> If we initiate the arbitration, we will notify you in writing at your then-current account address or (if your account is closed) the last address at which we contacted you. If you initiate the arbitration, you must notify us in writing at the address set forth in the "Notices" section below.</p>
    <p> If your Dispute does not exceed $10,000, we will promptly reimburse your filing fee and will pay the arbitrator's other fees, costs and expenses. (If you cannot pay the filing fee, you may request that we pay the filing fee directly.) If, however, the arbitrator finds that your Dispute is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, you shall reimburse the filing fee to us and the payment of the arbitrator's others fees, costs and expenses shall be governed by the arbitration administrator's rules.</p>
    <p> You may hire an attorney to represent you in the arbitration proceeding and may recover your reasonable attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration to the same extent as you could in court if the arbitration proceeding is decided in your favor. We may hire an attorney to represent us in the arbitration proceeding but waive any right to recover our attorneys' fees and costs if the arbitration proceeding is decided in our favor.</p>
    <p> Unless you and we agree otherwise in writing, any arbitration hearings will be held in the county of your then-current account address or (if your account is closed) the last address at which we contacted you.</p>
    <p> You must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent (see Section 16) to begin arbitration. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will arbitrate all disputes. For claims less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for claims over $75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA rules are available at or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Upon filing of the arbitration demand, we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims that total less than $75,000. For claims that total more than $75,000, the payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees. In addition, for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Except for claims determined to be frivolous, Metro PCS agrees not to seek an award of attorneys’ fees in arbitration even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>If the arbitration provision applies or you choose arbitration to resolve your disputes, then either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.</h2>
    <p> www.adr.org</p>
    <p> If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>. WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>If you choose to pursue your claim in court by opting out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this Class Action Waiver provision will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt out requirements above.</h2>
    <p> If a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, .</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>JURY TRIAL WAIVER</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL</h2>
    <p> ARBITRATION INVOLVES A FAIR HEARING BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR RATHER THAN A JUDGE OR JURY. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD DECLARATORY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY NAMED IN THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.</p>
    <p> Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, or otherwise in this Agreement, neither party has the right to bring a Dispute or other legal action under this Agreement more than one (1) year after the Dispute arose.</p>
    <p> You are a month-to-month customer. If you terminate your Service, your termination will be effective at the end of your current month of Service (unless you port-out your number), and you will remain responsible for all fees and Charges for your Service and usage through the end of that period. If we terminate your Service, we will determine the date of termination, and you will be responsible for all usage and Charges through the date of termination. You can request that we port your number to another carrier, and Service for that number will be terminated when the porting is complete. If you port your number, you will be responsible for all usage and Charges until the port-out is complete.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>3. * Your Term of Service.</h2>
    <p> The Services are provided via Rate Plans under which you do not pay metered "per minute" charges for service. In an effort to offer this Service on a reliable basis, MetroPCS may discontinue providing Service to you, change the services provided to you, change your Rate Plan, reduce the speed of any service provided, restrict the amount of use of any service, change the services and features in your Rate Plan, discontinue your account, or discontinue or limit providing connections to particular telephone numbers, countries, destinations, providers, features, requested or called by you or the provision of certain services in certain areas, such as pursuant to roaming arrangements, or services that appear likely to generate abnormally high use, or other disproportionate use when compared to those of other customers of MetroPCS (as described below under Section 24 "Your Use Of The Service") or which may be harmful, disruptive, or interfere with MetroPCS' system or services to other customers. We may provide notice to you prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, but you acknowledge and agree that we are not required to provide notice and you agree that we may take any of the foregoing actions without providing notice you. By initiating service and placing calls or using any other service on the MetroPCS system, you acknowledge and agree to MetroPCS' ability to modify or terminate your Service under these circumstances.</p>
    <p> For MetroPCS Device and accessory returns and exchanges, see the applicable return policy, which is available at your place of purchase. Amounts paid for Service charges are non-refundable. If your Service is terminated for any reason and you have a positive balance in your Service account, you will not be entitled to receive any refund.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>4. Return Policy and Refund Policy.</h2>
    <p> This Section describes how changes may be made to your Agreement, is subject to requirements and limitations imposed by applicable law, and will not be enforced to the extent prohibited by law. We may change the price and structure of your Rate Plan, modify the various Rate Plans, change the price of the various Rate Plans, change the services included in a Rate Plan, or change the requirements of eligibility for Rate Plans, at any time without prior notice to you. You may designate others to manage or make changes to your account ("Authorized Users"). You and any Authorized Users on your account will have access to all account information. If you give your personal account validation information to someone, they can access, and may be able to make changes to your account just as you can, including incurring charges for which you are responsible. Those changes will be binding on you. MetroPCS takes no responsibility for changes made to your account by any Authorized User.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>5. Changes to Your Service.</h2>
    <p> With respect to domestic long distance, roaming, international long distance, and any other service provided by us (or to us by third parties), we may change the locations and destinations where such Services may be used or where calls can be placed or placed in specific Rate Plans, or the rates and terms applicable to such locations and destinations, without prior notice to you. Certain charges may be imposed by third parties and MetroPCS may, as an accommodation, allow such charges to be paid through MetroPCS.</p>
    <p> YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THESE RATE PLAN CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT THE RATE PLAN CHANGES, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE CHANGE THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT NOTIFY US THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE WITHIN THAT TIME AND/OR IF YOU CONTINUE TO USE THE SERVICE AFTER THE RATE PLAN CHANGES, YOU ACCEPT THE CHANGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY TERMINATION, AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY PAID ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.</p>
    <p> We may change this Agreement at any time. If you are an existing customer, you will be notified at least ten (10) days, unless a longer period is required, in advance of any proposed changes that may result in more restrictive terms or conditions in this Agreement. Any such changes to this Agreement will be effective after that time period.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>6. Our Rights to Make Changes.</h2>
    <p> YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT THE CHANGES, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE CHANGE NOTICE THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT NOTIFY US THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE WITHIN THAT TIME AND/OR IF YOU CONTINUE TO USE THE SERVICE AFTER NOTIFICATION OF THE CHANGES, YOU ACCEPT THE CHANGES.</p>
    <p> You may buy a wireless device to use on our Service from us or someone else, but it must, as solely determined by us, comply with Federal Communications Commission regulations, be certified for use on our network, and be compatible with, and not potentially harm, our Service or our network. Our Services will only work with wireless devices compatible with our network and not all services are available with all wireless devices or on all networks. Some features and Rate Plans will be available only on MetroPCS wireless devices purchased from us. At times we may remotely change your wireless device's software, applications or programming, without notice to address security, safety, or other issues that impact our network or your device. These changes will modify your wireless device and may affect or erase data you have stored on your wireless device, or how you have programmed or use your wireless device. A MetroPCS wireless device is designed to be used only with our service and on our network. Your wireless device may not work with another wireless network, or the other wireless carrier may not accept your wireless device on its network. If your wireless device was purchased from MetroPCS or an authorized MetroPCS dealer, the wireless device has a software programming lock that will prevent the wireless device from operating with other compatible wireless telephone carriers' services. Please see www.metropcs.com/unlockpolicy for information regarding our software programming unlocking policy. Your wireless device may contain sensitive or personal information. MetroPCS is not responsible for any information on your wireless device, including sensitive or personal information. If possible, you should remove or otherwise safeguard any sensitive or personal information when your wireless device is out of your possession or control, including, but not limited to, relinquishing, exchanging, returning or recycling your wireless device. By providing your wireless device to us, you agree that our employees, contractors or vendors may access all of the information on your wireless device.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>7. * Your Wireless Device and Compatibility with Other Networks and Equipment.</h2>
    <p> Service is limited to the operating range, spectrum, and capacity of our, or our roaming partners’, wireless system in your service area. Your Service area is the area depicted in the coverage map available to you when you activated Service and may change from time to time without notice. Since MetroPCS uses different spectrum in different areas of the country, service may not be available on all wireless devices in all areas. We may, but are not obligated to, provide notice when you are being served by a carrier other than ourselves. The specific network coverage you get will depend on the radio transmissions your wireless device can receive and use, and the Services you have chosen. Except for 911 calls and any "roaming" service to which you have subscribed, you will not be able to use your wireless device outside of your service area for any calls, including local, long distance and international calls. Further, since services outside MetroPCS' area are provided by third parties, not all services may work outside your service area.MetroPCS takes no responsibility for Service interruptions or problems caused by factors beyond our control. Any statements by MetroPCS, its employees, representatives or agents about the coverage of our system are intended only to describe MetroPCS' approximate coverage in your service area. You should not interpret any such statement to mean that Service will be available or without interruption in any service area.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>8. Service Availability.</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>Specific Services may not be available on all wireless devices at all points in time due to wireless device hardware and/or software, changes to our network, network infrastructure, cessation of specific Services, or service by carriers other than ourselves.</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>Service depends on over-the-air radio transmissions. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using Services outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage is not available everywhere and depends on the Service purchased and the wireless device used. Service speeds are not guaranteed and actual speeds will vary. Estimating wireless coverage, signal strength and Service speed is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that may result in dropped and/or blocked connections, slower Service speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of Service. Many factors beyond our control affect your ability to make and receive calls on your wireless device, the quality of those calls, and the speed of your Service including, but not limited to, your location, the conditions of the atmosphere, terrain, nearby buildings and other structures, network capacity issues, system outages, failure of equipment to operate as expected, spectrum used, problems that occur with service we purchase from third parties, system upgrades, performance of system maintenance, accidents, network problems, network or Internet congestion, software, signal strength, your wireless device, weather, geography, topography, server speeds of the websites you access or other events outside of our control. As a result, sometimes Service, including calls or attempted calls to emergency services like 911, may be unavailable, interrupted or may fail, and the quality of calls may sometimes be poor.</h2>
    <p> When making a 911 call, always state the nature of your emergency and provide both your location and phone number, as the operator may not automatically receive this information. Services that rely on location information, such as E911, GPS navigation, and our wireless network depend on your wireless device's ability to acquire satellite signals and network coverage. Unlike traditional wireline telephones, depending on a number of factors (for example, where you are, whether local emergency service providers have upgraded their equipment, etc.), 911 operators may not know your telephone number, your location or the location of your wireless device. Other third party entities are involved in connecting a 911 call. MetroPCS makes no guarantee that emergency 911 calls will be routed to a specific Public Safety Answering Point ("PSAP") or any particular public safety organization (for example, police department, fire department, ambulance services, etc.). MetroPCS takes no responsibility for the acts or omissions of any PSAP or any public safety organization (for example, police department, fire department, ambulance services, etc.). In certain circumstances, an emergency call may be routed to a state patrol dispatcher or alternative location set by local emergency service providers. Enhanced 911 service ("E911"), where enabled by local emergency authorities, uses GPS or network technologies to provide location information. Even when available, however, E911 does not always provide accurate location information, and in some cases may not generate a location at all. If your wireless device is indoors or for some other reason cannot acquire a satellite signal, you may not be located. Some wireless devices have a safety feature that prevents use of the keypad after dialing 911. You should follow voice prompts when interacting with emergency service providers employing Interactive Voice Response ("IVR") systems to screen calls. While your wireless device is receiving a software update, you may be unable to use your wireless device in any manner until the software update is complete. If you are porting a phone number to or from us, we may not be able to provide you with some Services, such as 9-1-1 location services, while the port is in process. Your wireless device may require you to elect to use location based services, or you may choose to use location based services, other than E911. If you elect to use non-E911 location based services, you agree that we may use the location information transmitted from your wireless device to improve our location services. Your personal, biographical and calling information will not be used by us. By electing to use location based services, you agree and authorize us to send targeted, location based information to your mobile device and also to use or provide to third parties your location information in an aggregate form. MetroPCS has chosen to offer wireless emergency alerts, within portions of its coverage area, on wireless alert capable Devices. There is no additional charge for these wireless emergency alerts. For details on the availability of this service and wireless emergency alert capable Devices, please visit https://www.metropcs.com/terms-conditions/wireless-emergency-alerts.html .</p>

    <h2>9. Location Based Services; Important Emergency and 9-1-1 Information; and Emergency Alerts.</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>MetroPCS is not responsible for failures to connect or complete 911 calls or if inaccurate location information is provided.</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>911 service may not be available or reliable and your ability to receive emergency services may be impeded.</h2>

    <h2>Emergency Alerts</h2>
    <p> Depending on your Rate Plan, your usage of Data Access may be metered by Us. Your Rate Plan may include a Data Access usage limit, such as 2 GB per service cycle. We shall determine in our sole discretion what data usage constitutes Data Access and reserve the right to alter, make additions to or deletions to what type of data usage, or protocols, constitute Data Access without notification to you. Data Access may include, for example, multimedia streaming and video on demand services, as well as certain multimedia uploads, downloads and gaming services and applications. Uploads are data sessions where the data is transferred from your Wireless Device to some other computer or wireless device, while downloads are data sessions where the data is transferred from some other computer or wireless device to your Wireless Device. Depending on your Rate Plan, certain usages may not count against your Data Access limit. Data Access does not include any data services or uses which are prohibited by Us under this Agreement, such as in the MetroWEB Terms of Use. Data Access usage includes, but is not limited to, the actual data sent and received along with overhead, header packets, and may include other information sent in connection with a data session in which Data Access occurs. Data Access on networks not owned by us, such as when you are roaming, may not be available or may be further limited. Charges and availability are based on the location of the cell site receiving and transmitting the Data Access service and not your location.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>10. * Data Plans and Other Features. Data Access.</h2>
    <p> The absolute capacity of the wireless data network is limited. Accordingly, Data Access is only provided for prescribed purposes and pricing for Data Access is device dependent and based on the transmit and receive capacity of each device. A Data Access pricing plan designated for one type of device may not be used with another device. Compatible data-enabled wireless devices are required.</p>
    <p> You acknowledge and agree that your Data Access usage and speed may vary depending on certain factors outside of our control. Such factors may include the amount of users on the service, network congestion, the distance to the serving cell site, the number of users served by your serving cell site, the management of backhaul at the serving cell site, any application(s) you are using for your data session, the screen size of your Wireless Device, the bit rate(s) of your data session, the type(s) and amount(s) of compression used by the computers or wireless devices involved in the data session, and any error(s) that might occur in the data session. We also manage our network to facilitate the proper functioning of services that require consistent high speeds, such as video calling, which may, particularly at times and in areas of network congestion, result in reduced speeds for other services. Additionally, we may implement other network management practices, such as deploying streaming video optimization technology and prioritizing all Smartphone Mobile Hotspot (tethering) data below on-device data. This technology is intended to manage data usage on the network, reduce the risk of streaming video stalling and buffering, and reduce the amount of high-speed data consumption used for streaming video. Streaming video optimization improves streaming video reliability as well as makes room for other users to enjoy higher browsing speeds. The streaming video optimization process is agnostic as to the streaming video content itself and to the website that provides it. While most changes to streaming video files are likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may minimally impact the appearance of the streaming video as displayed on a user’s device. These practices operate without regard to the content itself or the source of the content, and do not discriminate against offerings that might compete against those offered by MetroPCS on the basis of such competition. In order to assess your usage during an applicable service cycle, you may obtain approximate usage information by using one of our automated systems. Any application on your Wireless Device which describes the amount of data usage does not necessarily reflect your usage of Data Access. We may provide a meter for your use in one or more locations accessible by you. Any meter provided for your use may deliver readings higher or lower than your actual Data Access usage, or deliver readings that are higher than your actual Data Access usage because of the units of measurement used by Us. Any reading delivered by any meter we provide for your use will have inherent inaccuracies and may not provide up to the minute or second accuracy. Further, any reading delivered by any meter We provide for your use may only be completely accurate if your Wireless Device is turned off and not transmitting or receiving any data from any data session.</p>
    <p> MetroPCS reserves the right to manage our network and the traffic on our network in the way we believe best benefits our customers and best enables us to maintain Service of the nature described in this Agreement. We have determined that our ability to provide Service to our customers is disrupted when you place an abnormally high number of calls, repeatedly place calls which result in abnormally long call lengths, high or disproportionate use, or otherwise use our Services or network in excess of our expectations for the normal amount of use by our customers. Other examples of prohibited uses can be found in Section 17. If you use your service in a manner that could interfere with other customers’ service, affect our ability to allocate network capacity among customers or degrade service quality for other customers, we may suspend, terminate, or restrict your Service. Some elements of multimedia messages may not be accessible, viewable, or heard due to limitations on certain wireless phones, PCs, or e-mail. We reserve the right to change the multimedia message size limit at any time without notification. Text message notifications may be sent to non-multimedia messaging subscribers if they subscribe to text messaging. You may receive unsolicited messages from third parties as a result of visiting Internet sites, and a per-message charge may apply whether the message is read or unread, solicited or unsolicited.</p>

    <h2>Network Traffic Management.</h2>
    <p> To differentiate the services we sell, at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, we give the data traffic of customers who choose T-Mobile-branded services precedence over the data traffic of customers who choose non-T-Mobile-branded services such as MetroPCS. Where the network is lightly loaded, a MetroPCS customer will notice little, if any, effect from having lower priority. This will be the case in the vast majority of times and locations. At times and at locations where the network is heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, however, MetroPCS customers will likely see reductions in data speeds, especially if they are engaged in data-intensive activities. Customers on Rate Plans and Devices with 4G capability should, for example, be aware that these practices may occaisionally result in speeds below those typically experienced on our 4G LTE and HSPA networks. MetroPCS constantly works to improve network performance and capacity, but there are physical and technical limits on how much capacity is available, and at constrained locations, the frequency of heavy loading in relation to available capacity may be greater than at other locations. When network loading goes down or the MetroPCS customer moves to a location that is less heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, the MetroPCS customer‘s speeds will likely improve. See metropcs.com/openinternet for details.</p>
    <p> MetroPCS also reserves the right to restrict, or otherwise prevent access to services, countries, carriers, destinations that MetroPCS determines, in its sole discretion, are inconsistent with the nature of Service provided by MetroPCS, are indicative of uses not permitted hereunder, or result in abnormally long calls, or abnormally high usage. We also may block calls to telephone numbers at the request of the called party.</p>
    <p> You can purchase Content and Applications (for example, downloadable, streaming or networked applications, wallpapers, ringtones, games, productivity tools and video) ("Content and Apps") for and with your compatible wireless device. Some Content and Apps that you can purchase with your wireless device are not sold by MetroPCS and for such Content and Apps, you can identify the third party seller at the point of purchase. MetroPCS is not responsible for such Content and Apps, including download, installation, use, transmission failure, interruption, or delay, or any content or website you may be able to access through the Content and Apps. Any support questions for such Content and Apps should be directed to the third party seller identified at the point of purchase. When you download or install any Content and Apps sold by a third party seller, you may be subject to license terms between you and the third party seller and Content and Apps creator/owner. When you use, install, display, run, or listen to Content and Apps that you purchase from MetroPCS, the Content and Apps are licensed to you by MetroPCS and may be subject to additional license terms between you and the creator/owner of the Content and Apps. Whether purchased from MetroPCS or a third party seller, any Content and Apps you purchase are licensed for personal, lawful, non-commercial use on your wireless device only. You may not transfer, copy, or reverse engineer any Content and Apps, or alter, disable or circumvent any digital rights management security features embedded in the Content and Apps.

You understand that your use of such location-sensitive applications is subject to the application's terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy policy. If you activate location-sensitive services for wireless devices used by other Authorized Users, you agree to inform the Authorized User(s) of the terms of use for location-sensitive applications and that the wireless device may be located.

    <h2>Third Party Applications</h2>
    <p> Your wireless device may connect to another provider’s network (“Off-Net”) even when you are within our service area. Our Services and Rate Plans are designed for you to use your Service each month predominantly using our networks. You must use your wireless device predominantly within the MetroPCS owned network coverage area. If your minutes of use, text messaging usage, or data usage are not predominantly on our networks ("Off-Net Usage"), or are excessive, abnormally high, or cause MetroPCS to incur too much cost, MetroPCS may, at its option and sole discretion, limit or terminate your service, deny your continued use outside the areas served by our network or on other carriers' coverage, or change your Rate Plan. MetroPCS will provide you with advance notice that it intends to take any of the above actions. Nationwide roaming requires multi-band wireless devices and is not available with single-band wireless devices, certain other wireless devices, or to customers residing outside their home area. Data services and certain features (for example, Voicemail, Caller ID, Call Waiting, Location Services, etc.) may not be available in all roaming areas. The term "roaming" typically refers to coverage on another carrier's network that we may make available to you based on our agreements with other carriers. These agreements may change from time to time and roaming coverage and available services are subject to change without notice. Your ability to roam depends on the radio transmissions your wireless device can receive and use, and the availability of roaming coverage. We make no guaranty that roaming coverage will be available. Roaming coverage may exist both within and outside our network coverage areas. Depending on your Services, separate charges or limits on the amount of minutes used while roaming may apply. We may, but you agree we are not obligated to, provide you with notice when you are roaming.</p>

    <h2>YOU AGREE TO HOLD METROPCS HARMLESS AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, ACTIONS, OR OTHER CAUSES OF ACTION (INCLUDING ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OF THE SERVICE.</h2>
    <p> You agree to pay for all charges for Service ("Service Charges"), including, but not limited to the following: (1) recurring monthly or weekly access charges; (2) charges and taxes for optional Service features that you select, including long distance and directory assistance (411) calls and other optional features, such as ringtone downloads; (3) any Service reconnection charges that may apply, such as a reactivation fee; and (4) all applicable taxes and regulatory charges whether assessed directly on you or us; provided, however, that for certain tax inclusive Rate Plans, only applicable taxes and regulatory charges may be included in the Rate Plan price. You must pay all taxes, fees and surcharges set by federal, state and local governments. To determine taxes, fees and surcharges, we will use the street address you identified as your Place of Primary Use ("PPU"). If you did not identify the correct PPU, or provided an address that is not a recognized street address, such as a PO Box, does not identify the applicable taxing jurisdictions or does not reflect the Service area associated with your telephone number, you may be assigned a default PPU for tax purposes. You acknowledge and agree that a default PPU may affect your ability to receive E-911 assistance and you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for any claims relating to your failure to provide a valid PPU. In addition, if you are not on a tax-inclusive plan, you agree to pay all regulatory administration charges ("Regulatory Administration Charges"), which may include, but are not limited to, Federal Universal Service, various regulatory charges, our administrative charges, gross receipts charges, margin taxes, and charges for the costs we incur in complying with governmental programs. Regulatory Administration Charges are not taxes and are not required by law. We set these charges, and the amounts and what they include may change without notice. They are rates we choose to collect from you and are kept by us in whole or in part. The number and type of Regulatory Administration Charges may vary depending upon the PPU of the wireless device and can change over time. We determine the rate for these charges and these amounts are subject to change as are the components used to calculate these amounts. Changes to taxes, fees and surcharges will become effective as provided by the taxing authority and changes to Regulatory Administration Charges shall be effective immediately. You are responsible for all Charges to your account, whether or not you were the user of the wireless device. If your wireless device gets lost or stolen, you agree to notify us immediately, so we can suspend your Service to prevent someone else from using it. After your Service is suspended, you will not be responsible for additional usage charges incurred in excess of your Rate Plan Charges, applicable taxes, fees, and Surcharges. If you request that we not suspend your Service, you will remain responsible for all usage, Charges incurred, and applicable taxes and fees. We may prevent a lost or stolen wireless device from registering on our and other networks. Wireless access to corporate/employee email may require additional server or server access, licenses, or additional requirements which may incur additional charges. By requesting wireless access to corporate/employee email, you agree to pay any of these additional charges. Certain parties besides MetroPCS have the ability to place charges on your bill for their services. You may access these services and authorize the placement of charges on your bill through your phone or online account. MetroPCS also provides customers, at no additional cost, with the ability to restrict the placement of charges for third-party services on your account.

    <h2>Billing for Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p> www.metropcs.com/blocking</p>
    <p> Service Charges must be paid in advance and are due before the first day of your service cycle. Service Charges cannot be paid in arrears. Unless otherwise specified in your Rate Plan, monthly service cycles are approximately 30 days long. The dates of your monthly or weekly service cycle and other dates related to your account may change from time to time. You must promptly notify us of any change in your billing address. As a convenience, you may authorize recurring payment of your Service Charges through a credit or debit card or bank transfer authorization; this authorizes us to charge all amounts you owe us to the credit or debit card or bank transfer authorization up to five (5) days prior to the due date and to demand immediate payment from the card or debit issuer or bank. Unless required by law, we will not give any additional notice to you or obtain additional consent from you before charging Service Charges to that credit or debit card. You must promptly notify us of any change in the credit or debit card or bank transfer authorization you want to use for payment. You may also make a payment by credit or debit card online at www.metropcs.com or through the automated MetroPCS IVR. In addition, you may pay your Service Charges by sending a check or money order by mail to P.O. Box 5119, Carol Stream, Illinois, 60197-5119, or by bringing cash, check, or money order in person to any MetroPCS store or authorized payment center. You may be required to pay an additional service charge, depending on the payment method you choose. This information is available at MetroPCS.com. In addition, we may charge an additional fee up to the maximum amount permitted by law for any check or other negotiable instrument tendered by you and returned unpaid by a financial institution for any reason. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to require that you pay your Service Charges with cash, certified check, cashier's check, or money order. We also reserve the right to report any check returned to us to reporting and credit agencies and law enforcement.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>14. * Payments and Late Fees.</h2>
    <p> Your payment will be considered late if we do not receive it before the first day of the service cycle for which the payment is due. If you do not make all payments when they are due, you will be in default under this Agreement, and MetroPCS will be entitled to exercise any rights it may have under this Agreement, including the suspension or termination of Service to you. If we accept a late or partial payment, even if you mark the payment "paid in full," we do not waive our rights to suspend or terminate your Service or any other rights we may have. If your Service is terminated and you promptly pay amounts that are overdue, MetroPCS, in its sole discretion, may reconnect your Service after you have paid any reconnection fees we have imposed. In such case, your service cycle anniversary date will not change, which will result in fewer days of service for that month. If you have a dispute regarding the Charges to your account, or about the Services provided to you, you agree to notify us of the dispute within 60 days after the date you first receive the disputed Charge ("Dispute Period"), unless otherwise provided by law. If you do not notify us of your dispute in writing within the Dispute Period, you have waived such claim and will be forever barred and estopped from raising, or making a claim for such dispute and you may not pursue a claim in arbitration or in court. Unless otherwise provided by law, you must pay disputed Charges until the dispute is resolved. If you accept a credit, refund or other compensation or benefit to resolve a disputed Charge, you agree that the issue is fully and finally resolved and such credit shall act as an accord and satisfaction. In the event of a lost or stolen wireless device, for Charges incurred before you notify us, you are not liable for charges you did not authorize, but the fact that your wireless device or service was used is some evidence of authorization. You may request that we investigate Charges you believe were unauthorized. We may ask you to provide information and you may submit information to support your request. If we determine the charges were unauthorized, we will credit your account. If we determine the charges were authorized, we will inform you within 30 days and you will remain responsible for the charges.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>15. * Your right to Dispute Charges.</h2>
    <p> You expressly consent to be contacted, by MetroPCS or anyone calling on its behalf, for any and all purposes, at any telephone number, or physical or electronic address where you may be reached, including any wireless telephone number. You agree that MetroPCS may contact you in any way, including, pre-recorded or artificial voice or text messages delivered by an automatic telephone dialing system, or e-mail messages delivered by an automatic e-mailing system. You agree that we also have the consent to contact any Authorized User on your account for Service or payment related reasons. Any such notice will be treated as provided to you when left with you, on your wireless device, on your answering/voicemail service, or by email or fax to any email or fax number you provided to us, or 3-days after mailing to your last known address as shown in our records. Your consent to be contacted may be revoked only if it is in writing and is with MetroPCS’s express agreement. You must notify us of any address changes. Failure to notify us of a change in your address constitutes a breach of this Agreement and grounds for possible suspension or termination of your Service. If you have any questions regarding your Service or information in this Agreement, you may contact our Customer Care department at , by calling 1-888-8metro8, or by writing us at MetroPCS, P.O.

    <p> This Agreement shall be contingent upon our verification and approval of certain information about you. We reserve the right to deny or limit the provision of Service on the basis of any information that we gather. We may require that you provide us with additional or updated information we reasonably need to determine if you qualify for Service, to manage the Service, or to determine if you are using the Service in accordance with this Agreement. If you do not provide us the information we request within the time period that we specify, we may choose not to provide Service to you, or, if you are an existing customer, we may suspend or terminate Service to you. You warrant and represent that all information furnished to us by you is current, complete, accurate and true as of the time you provide it, and you will update it as necessary to keep it complete, accurate, and true. At any time, we may take any action that we believe necessary to verify or review your account activity or information you provide to us, including: (1) verification of your account information; (2) review of your use of Services and of your account to help assess the Services we provide and the performance of our systems; and (3) investigation of suspected prohibited use or violation of this Agreement or the Policies. We may share information we gather about you as provided elsewhere in this Agreement and in our Privacy Policy which is available at or by writing to us at the address in Section 16 "Notices". We also may share your information, including your personal information and customer proprietary network information, with any person who may purchase our business.</p>

    <h2>27.6 Account Activity and Information Verification.</h2>
    <p> www.metropcs.com</p>
    <p> You (the account holder) may password protect your account information by establishing a personal identification number ("PIN"). You may also set a backup security question and answer in the event you forget your PIN. You agree to protect your PIN, passwords and other account access credentials like your backup security question from loss or disclosure. It is your sole responsibility to protect your account by creating a password that is unknown to any other person. This password should never be shared nor should it be written down and kept in a place that is accessible to others. Should you feel that your password has been compromised you should immediately call MetroPCS to change your password. You further agree that MetroPCS may, in our sole discretion, treat any person who presents your credentials for account access as you or an Authorized User on the account for the purposes of disclosure of information or changes in your Rate Plan or Service.</p>
    <p> We will assign a telephone number (the "Number") to your wireless device. You do not own nor have any rights to the Number or any personal identification number ("PIN") that you may use in connection with your Service, except for any right you may have to port the Number to another carrier. We also may assign an Internet Protocol address ("IP Address") to your wireless device. You do not own or have any rights to the IP Address. We can change, reassign, or eliminate any Number or PIN by giving you notice and your IP Address without giving you notice. If your account is deactivated, we can reassign the Number or IP Address without giving you any notice. You may not assign the Number, PIN or IP Address to any wireless device, other equipment or to any other party except as approved by us. If you assign the Number, PIN or IP Address to any wireless device, other equipment or to any other party without our approval, we reserve the right to terminate your Service. You can request that we port your number to another carrier, and Service for that number will be terminated when the porting is complete. If you port your number, you will be responsible for all usage and Charges until the port-out is complete. If you port a Number to us, please be aware that we may not be able to provide some services right away, such as 911 location services. You may be required to purchase a new wireless device and you may be without Service for some period of time. MetroPCS may charge a fee to reimburse MetroPCS for the costs MetroPCS incurs to meet the equipment, technology and infrastructure requirements necessary to enable number porting. MetroPCS may also charge a fee to reimburse MetroPCS for the cost MetroPCS incurs to perform a port. As a standard service feature, MetroPCS transmits your Number, account name, and address with each call or data session you make from your MetroPCS wireless device. Your account name, Number, and IP Address may be displayed on the telephone or other device of the party called if that person uses caller identification. Your Number and location may also be transmitted to public safety officials if you dial 911 or other emergency service numbers. Your name and Number for most calls can be blocked on a call-by-call basis by dialing *67 before the telephone area code and telephone number (on certain devices there may be a different number). In addition, you may elect to have your name and Number permanently blocked, at no charge, by sending a request in writing to: MetroPCS, P.O. Box 601119, Dallas, Texas, 75360-1119.</p>

    <p> Published: December 31, 2016</p>
    <p> This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by MetroPCS™ and T-Mobile USA, Inc. (collectively, "MetroPCS," "we" or "us" or “our”) and provides other important privacy information, describes when and how we may change this Policy, and tells you how to contact us with any questions or comments.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h2>
    <p> We collect information about you and your associated device(s) when you use our products or services or otherwise interact with us or with third-party services through our products and services. Examples of the types of information we collect include:</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p> “Personal Information” means information that we directly associate with a specific person or entity (for example: name; addresses; telephone numbers; email address; Social Security Numbers; payment information; call records; wireless device location). Personal information does not include “de-identified,” “anonymous,” or “aggregate” information – which are not associated with a specific person or entity.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)</h2>
    <p> Customer Proprietary Network Information, or "CPNI," is a subset of Personal Information that is generated in connection with the telecommunications services we provide to you. CPNI includes, for example, call details, call location information, and certain information about your rate plans and features. CPNI does not include your name, address, and phone number.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Network and Device Information</h2>
    <p> We may collect information about your use of our network (or other carriers’ networks when roaming domestically and internationally) and the device(s) associated with your account, network data related to WiFi usage and device, and performance information, as well as data relating to your use of our website, applications and other products and services.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Location Data</h2>
    <p> We may collect your device's location whenever it is turned on (subject to coverage limitations).</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Performance and Diagnostic Data</h2>
    <p> We may collect performance and diagnostic data about your use of our network, networks you roam on, WiFi services or your device. For example, we may collect information about the performance of the device, signal strength, dropped calls, data failures, battery strength and other device or network performance issues. We may also collect information about applications on your device, the fact that an application has been added, when an application is launched or fails to launch, and length of time an application has been running.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Video Data</h2>
    <p> When you use a video application with your MetroPCS service, for example T?Mobile TV, on your device, we may collect information about the programs you watch to determine customer viewing habits so that we can tailor video selections to you or our customers.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Collection of Information About Children</h2>
    <p> We do not knowingly solicit children to purchase our services or products. If, however, you authorize a child to use our services or products by providing them a device associated with your account, any information associated with such use will be treated as your information in accordance with this Policy.</p>
    <p> Our websites are not designed to attract children under the age of 13 and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect Personal Information on our websites from anyone under the age of 13. We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental permission.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>HOW INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IS COLLECTED</h2>
    <p> MetroPCS collects information about you in three primary ways:</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Information You Provide</h2>
    <p> We collect information that you provide to us when you apply for and use or purchase our products or services or otherwise communicate with us.</p>
    <p> For example, some of the ways you may provide information to us include:</p>
    <p> When you sign up for our voice or data services or purchase other products or services, we may collect personal contact, billing, and credit information.</p>
    <p> When you establish or modify an account online, we may collect user identification information, passwords, and/or security question responses that you will use for future sign-on.</p>
    <p> When you interact with our customer service representatives, enter information on our websites, submit survey responses, or pay for services, we may also collect Personal Information and other information. We may monitor and record phone calls, e-mails, live chats, or other communications between you, your device, and our Customer Service representatives or other employees or representatives.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>Automatically</h2>
    <p> We automatically collect a variety of information associated with your use of your device (on our network, whenroaming,or in WiFi mode) and our products and services, some of which may be associated with you.</p>
    <p> For example, some of the ways we may automatically collect information include:</p>
    <p> Our systems capture details about the type and location of wireless device(s) you use, when the device is turned on, calls and text messages you send and receive, and other data services you use.</p>
    <p> We may also gather information about the performance of your device and the network. Some examples of the types of data collected include: the applications on the device, signal strength, dropped calls, data failures, and other device or network performance issues.</p>
    <p> We may use, or we may engage third-parties to use on our behalf, cookies or similar web tags (small data text files placed on your computer or device) or similar technologies to identify your computer or device and record your preferences and other data so that our websites can personalize your visit(s), see which areas and features of our websites are popular, and improve our websites and your experience. We may also use web beacons (small graphic images on a web page or an HTML e-mail) to monitor interaction with our websites or e-mails. Web beacons are generally invisible because they are very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page or e-mail message. The information we receive through cookies, web beacons and similar technologies may enable us to recognize users across devices, such as smartphones, computers, tablets or related browsers. Depending upon your device or computer, you may be able to set your browser(s) to reject cookies or delete cookies, but that may result in the loss of some functionality on our websites. If we combine or link cookie or web beacon information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined or linked information as Personal Information under this Policy.</p>
    <p> Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies</p>
    <p> . When accessing our websites, mobile websites and related applications and widgets designed for your device or web-based experience, we automatically collect certain information about your device and your visit, such as your IP address, browser type, date and time, the web page you visited before visiting our website, your activities and purchases on our websites, and other analytical information associated with the sites.. When your device’s web browser utilizes our data services to access websites other than our own, we automatically capture information associated with your browsing activities, and measure and monitor network and Internet connection performance, throughput, latency, and similar network data. Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites (or the third party content on those sites) may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites’ privacy practices. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, we do not currently respond to the browser DNT signals on when you use our services and products or interact with our websites or online services. We do allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services for online interest based advertising purposes as described .</p>

    <p> Do Not Track Policy.</p>
    <p> If you use a voice-controlled application, that application may collect and record your requests and other information from you and your phone.</p>
    <p> Voice Controlled Applications</p>
    <p> We may use beacon devices in our retail locations that collect data about your device. These programs use signals from smart devices (like mobile phones and tablets) to track movement and wait times. Retail beacons collect a unique identifier that your device routinely transmits (, a MAC address) and coverts it to an identifier unique to T-Mobile. In some cases, we will use identifiers that are already routinely collected by the T-Mobile network in order to provide you with wireless service. We use aggregated data in order to understand general traffic trends in our stores. This helps us to better service our customers.</p>
    <p> Retail Beacons</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Information From Other Sources</h2>
    <p> We may also obtain information about you from other sources. For example, we may receive credit information from third-party sources before initiating your service, and updated address information from our shippers or other vendors. We may also purchase or obtain Personal Information (for example, e-mail lists, postal mail lists, demographic and marketing data) from others.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h2>
    <p> We use the information we collect for a variety of business purposes, such as:</p>
    <p> To route your calls or messages or otherwise provide you with service;</p>
    <p> To provide and bill for products and services you purchase and charge to your account;</p>
    <p> To deliver and confirm products and services you obtain from us;</p>
    <p> To verify your identity and maintain a record of your transactions and interactions with us;</p>
    <p> To provide customer and technical services to you;</p>
    <p> To create, modify, improve, enhance, remove or fix our network, products and services and their performance;</p>
    <p> To identify and suggest products or services that might interest you;</p>
    <p> To make internal business decisions about current and future product and service offerings;</p>

    <p> To protect our rights, interests, safety and property and that of our customers, service providers and other third parties; and</p>
    <p> To comply with law or as required for legal purposes.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Fraud Prevention</h2>
    <p> We may use Personal Information, including account information (such as purchase patterns) and device information for investigations or prevention of fraud or network abuse. We provide fraud prevention services to banks or other third parties. As part of this service, we may verify your phone number to help those third parties prevent your personal information from being used for fraudulent purposes. We also may provide the information you report as spam to 7726 to a third party to prevent fraud or network abuse, and we may share such information with government agencies and others that work to combat spam and prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair practices.</p>

    <h2>Information Collected from Cookies</h2>
    <p> We may also use information collected from cookies or other similar technologies to improve our websites, make recommendations, and complete transactions you request.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Marketing</h2>
    <p> We may use information we collect to contact you about T-Mobile or third-party products, services, and offers that we believe you may find of interest. We may contact you by telephone, postal mail, e-mail, or other methods. You may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time as outlined below in Choices Regarding Use of Your Information.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Performance, Diagnostics & Management</h2>
    <p> We collect information about devices, our network and WiFi usage to perform diagnostic analyses and understand how your device is performing overall. Diagnostic data helps us troubleshoot technical issues related to your device’s performance such as battery life, dropped calls, processing speed, device memory, service coverage, and network and WiFi signal strength that you and other customers may experience.

    <h2>Location-Based Services</h2>
    <p> We use location information to route wireless communications and to provide 911 service, which allows emergency services to locate your general location. We may disclose, without your consent, the approximate location of a wireless device to a governmental entity or law enforcement authority when we are served with lawful process or reasonably believe there is an emergency involving risk of death or serious physical harm.</p>
    <p> Depending on your device, you may also be able to obtain a wide array of services based on the location of your device (for example, driving directions, enhanced 411 Directory Assistance or search results, etc.). These data services, known as Location-Based Services (“LBS”) are made available by us and others, usually via applications. These services use various location technologies and acquire location data from various sources.</p>
    <p> These applications and services use various location technologies (including Global Positioning Satellite (“GPS”), Assisted GPS (“AGPS”), cell ID and enhanced cell ID technologies) to identify the approximate location of a device, which is then used in conjunction with the application to enhance the user’s experience (for example, to provide driving directions, to provide enhanced 411 Directory Assistance or search results, etc.)</p>
    <p> LBS may, or may not, involve any interaction with or dependency on our network, and location-based services may or may not look to our network to obtain location data. Where weallow third parties the capability of accessing data about your location that is derived from our network, we require those third parties to observe specific privacy and security protections consistent with this policy.</p>
    <p> It is important that you understand the location capabilities and settings of your device, and that you carefully read and understand the terms under which these services are provided – whether by us or another entity.</p>
    <p> You should carefully review the privacy policies and other terms of third-parties with whom you have authorized the sharing of your location information, and you should consider the risks involved in disclosing your location information to other people.</p>
    <p> Where we provide a location-based service, you will receive notice of the location features of the service and collection of location data is with your consent. You will be provided options for managing when and how such information should be shared. MetroPCS and T-Mobile follow the CTIA’s Best Practices Guidelines for Location-Based Services, which are available .</p>
