    <p> About Google</p>
    <p> For example, we can make search more relevant and interesting for you by including photos, posts, and more from you and your friends.</p>
    <p> "more relevant search results"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, you could get suggestions of people you might know or want to connect with on Google+, based on the connections you have with people on other Google products, like Gmail; and people who have a connection with you may see your profile as a suggestion.</p>
    <p> "connect with people"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, if someone is already a contact, Google will autocomplete their name if you want to add them to a message in Gmail.</p>
    <p> "sharing with others quicker and easier"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, if you frequently visit websites and blogs about gardening, you may see ads related to gardening as you browse the web.</p>
    <p> "ads you’ll find most useful"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of a message you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses from your Contacts list.</p>
    <p> "the people who matter most to you online"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> Whilst we currently don’t ask for a credit card during sign up, verifying your age through a small credit card transaction is one way to confirm that you meet our age requirements in case your account was disabled after you have entered a birthday indicating you are not old enough to have a Google Account.</p>
    <p> "credit card"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> This includes information like your usage data and preferences, Gmail messages, G+ profile, photos, videos, browsing history, map searches, docs, or other Google-hosted content.</p>
    <p> "collect information"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, we regularly report to advertisers on whether we served their ad to a page and whether that ad was likely to be seen by users (as opposed to, for example, being on part of the page to which users did not scroll).</p>
    <p> "view and interact with our ads"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, when you visit Google Play from your desktop, Google can use this information to help you decide on which devices you'd like your purchases to be available for use.</p>
    <p> "device-specific information"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> Device identifiers let Google know which unique device you are using to access our services, which can be used to customise our service to your device or analyse any device issues related to our services.</p>
    <p> "device identifiers"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, if you add a phone number as a recovery option, if you forget your password Google can send you a text message with a code to enable you to reset it.</p>
    <p> "phone number"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, Google Maps can center the maps view on your current location.</p>
    <p> "may collect and process information about your actual location"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> Your device may have sensors that provide information to assist in a better understanding of your location. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine things like speed, or a gyroscope to figure out direction of travel.</p>
    <p> "and other sensors"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, Google can approximate your device’s location based on the known location of nearby cell towers.</p>
    <p> "Wi-Fi access points and cell towers"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> We allow trusted businesses to use cookies or similar technologies for advertising and research purposes on our services.</p>
    <p> "and our partners"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, if you frequently visit websites and blogs about gardening that show our ads, you may start to see ads related to this interest as you browse the web.</p>
    <p> "advertising services"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> Google Analytics is based on first-party cookies. Data generated through Google Analytics can be linked, by the Google Analytics customer or by Google, using Google technology, to third-party cookies, related to visits to other websites, for instance when an advertiser wants to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.</p>
    <p> "linked with information about visits to multiple sites"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, the IP address assigned to your device is used to send the data you requested back to your device.</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, we continuously monitor our systems to check that they are working as intended and in order to detect and fix errors.</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, one reason we collect and analyze IP addresses and cookies is to protect our services against automated abuse.</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, Google’s spell checking software was developed by analyzing previous searches where users had corrected their own spelling.</p>
    <p> "develop new ones"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, if you're concerned about unauthorized access to your email, "Last account activity" in Gmail shows you information about recent activity in your email, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, as well as the time and date.</p>
    <p> "protect Google and our users"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, you can choose your settings so your name and photo do not appear in an ad.</p>
    <p> "limit sharing or visibility settings"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, cookies allow us to analyse how users interact with our services.</p>
    <p> "improve your user experience"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with pages, photos, and Google+ posts from your friends and people who know you or follow you on Google+ may see your posts and profile in their results.</p>
    <p> "combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services"</p>
    <p> Learn more.</p>
    <p> For example, if you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name.</p>
    <p> "to make it easier to share things with people you know"</p>

    <p> Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to hand over user data. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when the requests appear to be overly broad or don’t follow the correct process.</p>
