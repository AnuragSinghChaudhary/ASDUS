If an NSF website needs to collect information about a child under 13 years old, COPPA-required information and instructions will be provided by the specific web page that collects information about the child. The web page will specify exactly what the information will be used for, who will see it, and how long it will be kept.</p>
    <p> There are several exceptions that permit collection of a child's email address without receiving parental consent in advance:</p>
    <p> To provide the parents with notice and to seek consent for communications with the child. Note: this may require collection of the parent's email address as well.</p>
    <p> To respond to a one-time request from a child.</p>
    <p> To respond more than once to a child's request; i.e., subscription to a newsletter. However, parental consent is required prior to the second communication.</p>

    <p> To protect the site or to respond to law enforcement; i.e., in the case of a website compromise.</p>
    <p> Personal information about children under 13 years of age may be needed to respond to their communication to us, such as to receive a publication. Personal information about your child will be destroyed immediately upon completion of its intended purpose.</p>
    <p> Finally, we provide many on-line tools and services in support of NSF's mission. A child under 13 years old may inadvertently provide personal information to one of these services. If this should happen, the information about the child will be deleted immediately upon discovery.</p>
